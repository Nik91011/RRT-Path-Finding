# RRT-Path-Finding
This initiative employs the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for devising collision-free routes in autonomous vehicles. By starting from a designated point and navigating towards a predetermined target, the algorithm adeptly calculates a safe path on a map image, taking into account any present obstacles.
